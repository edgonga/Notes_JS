In order to create in a fast but completed way a Typescript template with server and client side, we will have to proceed as follows:

```
npm create vite@latest
```js


Once this command is run, some question to set up the project will be done

Regarding the frontend and backend languages to use (React + Typescript SWC)

Then, we will have to go inside the project folder (src in my case) and run "npm i" to download the dependencies correctly
